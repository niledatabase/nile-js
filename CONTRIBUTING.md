# Contributing to Nile-JS

Welcome to Nile-JS. We are glad you are interested in contributing to this project. We welcome contributions of all kinds, including bug reports, feature requests, code improvements, and documentation updates.

## Packages and Tech Stack

The core of the SDK is in two packages:

- **[Server](./packages/server/README.md)** - This package includes the configuration classes, methods and types for all Nile APIs (user management, tenant management, authentication), as well as a powerful query interface for working with your Nile database.
- **[React](./packages/react/README.md)** - This package includes the drop-in UI components and convenient hooks for authentication, user management and tenant management.

Each package/app is 100% [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).

We use [`yarn`](https://yarnpkg.com/) (please avoid `npm`) for managing dependencies and builds.
