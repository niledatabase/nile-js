# Nile's Client SDK

This package (`@niledatabase/client`) is part of [Nile's Javascript SDK](https://github.com/niledatabase/nile-js/tree/main).

Nile's React package provides:

- üé® UI components for authentication, user management, and tenant management (customizable with Tailwind CSS)
- ü™ù React hooks for authentication, user management, and tenant management functionality

You can browse all the components and explore their properties in [Nile's documentation](https://www.thenile.dev/docs/auth/components/signin) or in [Storybook](https://storybook.thenile.dev).

The components and hooks are designed to work best and provide a secure user experience when used with the generated routes provided by [Nile's Server-Side SDK](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@niledatabase/server).

**Nile is a Postgres platform that decouples storage from compute, virtualizes tenants, and supports vertical and horizontal scaling globally to ship B2B applications fast while being safe with limitless scale.** All B2B applications are multi-tenant. A tenant/customer is primarily a company, an organization, or a workspace in your product that contains a group of users. A B2B application provides services to multiple tenants. Tenant is the basic building block of all B2B applications.
